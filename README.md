# üìà Ruralytics: Dynamic Sales Forecasting Dashboard

**Ruralytics** is a powerful, interactive single-page web application that serves as a **front-end simulation** of a production-grade XGBoost sales forecasting model. It is a key portfolio piece demonstrating expertise in client-side data simulation, dynamic visualization, and sophisticated ML workflow representation using only **HTML, Vanilla JavaScript, and Chart.js**.

---

## ‚ú® Innovation & Core Features

Ruralytics' primary innovation is its ability to **dynamically analyze and forecast data** entirely on the client side, mimicking the intelligence of a server-side machine learning engine.

### üß† Intelligent ML Simulation

The application's JavaScript logic is engineered to provide a realistic, adaptive experience:

* **Custom Data-Driven Results:** Users input their own recent daily sales data, which the JavaScript logic instantly analyzes to determine trends and seasonality (e.g., weekend spikes).
* **Dynamic Feature Importance:** The model's key drivers (Feature Importance) are **not fixed**. They adjust on the fly based on the statistical patterns detected in the user's input, reflecting how a real model adapts to new data.
* **Realistic Workflow:** `async/await` and `setTimeout` are used to simulate the processing time for model "training" and prediction, enhancing the user's experience of a complex, back-end process.

### üìä Actionable Visualization Dashboard

All model output is presented on a single, modern dashboard using **Chart.js** for maximum clarity and interactivity.

* **14-Day Forecast:** Generates a sales projection complete with a **95% Confidence Interval**, vital for robust inventory and staffing decisions.
* **Performance Metrics:** Displays real-time model evaluation metrics like **MAE** (Mean Absolute Error) and **R¬≤** (Coefficient of Determination) after each analysis run.
* **Modern UI/UX:** Features a fully **responsive design** and an aesthetically pleasing, easy-to-use interface with a built-in **Dark Mode** toggle.
